<div class="p-content">

Python programs are executed by an interpreter. Usually, the interpreter is started by simply 
typing ``python``, ``python3`` or ``python3.6`` into a command shell. When the interpreter starts, 
a prompt appears at which you can start typing programs into a simple read-evaluation loop.


wzxhzdk:0


See this example of Python's interactive mode as a desktop calculator, which is one of its most 
useful features. For instance:


wzxhzdk:1


The special variable ``_`` holds the result of the last operation. This can be useful if you want 
to save or use the result of the last operation in subsequent statements.

If you want to create a program that you can run repeatedly, put statements in a file such as the 
following:


wzxhzdk:2


To execute the ``helloworld.py`` file, you provide the filename to the interpreter as follows:


wzxhzdk:3


On UNIX, you can use ``#!`` on the first line of the program, like this ``#!/usr/bin/env python3.6``.

The interpreter runs statements until it reaches the end of the input file. If it's running 
interactively, you can exit the interpreter by typing the EOF (end of file) character or by 
selecting **Exit** from pull-down menu of a Python IDE. On UNIX, EOF is ``<Ctrl+D>``; on Windows, 
it's ``<Ctrl+Z>``. A program can request to exit by raising the **SystemExit** exception.

<h2 id="variables-and-arithmetic-expressions">Variables and Arithmetic Expressions</h2>
<div class="p-content">

The following program shows the use of variables and expressions by performing a simple 
compound-interest calculation.


wzxhzdk:5


Running ``simple-compound-interest-calculation-01a.py`` with ``python3.6``, the output is:


wzxhzdk:6


Python is a dynamically typed language where variable names are bound to different values, possibly 
of varying types, during program execution. The assignment operator simply creates an association 
between a name and a value. Although each value has an associated type such as an integer or string, 
variable names are untyped and can be made to refer to any type of data during execution. This is 
different from C, for example, in which a name represents a fixed type, size, and location in memory 
into which a value is stored. This dynamic behavior can be seen with the ``principal`` variable. 
Initially, it's assigned to an integer value. However, later in the program it's reassigned as 
follows:


wzxhzdk:7


This statement evaluates the expression and reassociates the name ``principal`` with the result. 
Although the original value of ``principal`` was an integer ``1000``, the new value is now a 
floating-point number ( ``rate`` is defined as a float, so the value of the above expression is 
also a float). Thus, the apparent "type" of ``principal`` dynamically changes from an integer to a 
float in the middle of the program. However, to be precise, it's not the type of ``principal`` that 
has changed, but rather the value to which the ``principal`` name refers.

A newline terminates each statement. However, you can use a semicolon to separate statements on the 
same line, as shown here:


wzxhzdk:8


Also, Python doesn't specify the amount of required indentation, as long as it's consistent within 
a block. However, it is most common (and generally recommended) to use 
**four (04) spaces per indentation level**.

To make the output better, you could right-align the columns and limit the precision of 
``principal`` to two digits. There are several ways to achieve this formatting. One of these would
be to use the string formatting operator ``%`` like this:


wzxhzdk:9


Updating the code:


wzxhzdk:10


Running ``simple-compound-interest-calculation-01b.py`` with ``python3.6``, the output is:


wzxhzdk:11


Format strings contain ordinary text and special formatting-character sequences such as ``"%d"``, 
``"%s"``, and ``"%f"``. These sequences specify the formatting of a particular type of data such as 
an integer, string, or floating-point number, respectively. The special-character sequences can 
also contain modifiers that specify a width and precision. For example, ``"%3d"`` formats an 
integer right-aligned in a column of width 3, and ``"%0.2f"`` formats a floating-point number so 
that only two digits appear after the decimal point.

A more modern approach to string formatting is to format each part individually using the 
``format()`` function. For example:


wzxhzdk:12


Updating the code:


wzxhzdk:13


Running ``simple-compound-interest-calculation-01c.py`` with ``python3.6``, the output is:


wzxhzdk:14


The ``format()`` function uses format specifiers that are similar to those used with the 
traditional string formatting operator ``%``. For example, ``"3d"`` formats an integer 
right-aligned in a column of width 3, and ``"0.2f"`` formats a float-point number to have two 
digits of accuracy. Strings also have a ``format()`` method that can be used to format many values 
at once. For example:


wzxhzdk:15


The number before the colon in ``"{0:3d}"`` and ``"{1:0.2f}"`` refers to the associated argument 
passed to the ``format()`` method and the part after the colon is the format specifier.

Updating the code:


wzxhzdk:16


Running ``simple-compound-interest-calculation-01d.py`` with ``python3.6``, the output is:


wzxhzdk:17


</div>

<h2 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h2>
<div class="p-content">

The ``if`` and ``else`` statements can perform simple tests. Here's an example:


wzxhzdk:18


The bodies of the ``if`` and ``else`` clauses are denoted by indentation. The ``else`` clause is 
optional.

To create an empty clause, use the ``pass`` statement, as follows:


wzxhzdk:19


You can form Boolean expressions by using the ``or``, ``and``, and ``not`` keywords:


wzxhzdk:20


**Note**
> Writing complex test cases commonly results in statements that involve an annoyingly long line 
of code. To improve readability, you can continue any statement to the next line by using a 
backslash ``\`` at the end of a line as shown. If you do this, the normal indentation rules don't 
apply to the next line, so you are free to format the continued lines as you wish.

Keep in mind that Python does not have a special **switch** or **case** statement for testing 
values. To handle multiple-test cases, use the ``elif`` statement, like this:


wzxhzdk:21


It's possible to write workarounds of "switch/case" statements on Python. One of these would be 
the use of a **dictionary mapping**:


wzxhzdk:22


This code is analogous to:


wzxhzdk:23


Another approach would be the use of **dictionary mapping for functions**. In Python, we can also 
include functions or lambdas in our dictionary mapping:


wzxhzdk:24


While the code inside ``zero()`` and ``one()`` are simple, many Python programs use dictionary 
mappings like this to dispatch complex procedures.

A different approach would be the use of **dispatch methods for classes**. In Python, if we don't 
know what method to call on a class, we can use a dispatch method to determine it at runtime.


wzxhzdk:25


To denote truth values, use the **Boolean** values ``True`` and ``False``. Here's an example:


wzxhzdk:26


All relational operators such as ``<`` and ``>`` return ``True`` or ``False`` as results. 
The ``in`` operator used in this example is commonly used to check whether a value is contained 
inside of another object such as a string, list, or dictionary. It also returns ``True`` or 
``False``, so the preceding example could be shortened to this:


wzxhzdk:27


</div>

<h2 id="file-input-and-output">File Input and Output</h2>
<div class="p-content">

Imagine that you have a data file like this one:


wzxhzdk:28


This script opens a file and reads its contents line by line:


wzxhzdk:29


The ``open()`` function returns a new file object. By invoking methods on this object, you can 
perform various file operations. The ``readline()`` method reads a single line of input, including 
the terminating newline. The empty string is returned at the end of the file.

In the example, the program is simply looping over all the lines in the file ``datafile``. Whenever 
a program loops over a collection of data like this (for instance input lines, numbers, strings, 
etc.), it is commonly known as *iteration*. Because iteration is such a common operation, Python 
provides a dedicated statement, ``for``, that is used to iterate over items. For instance, the same 
program can be written much more succinctly as follows:


wzxhzdk:30


To make the output of a program go to a file, you can supply a file to the ``print`` statement, as 
shown in the following example:


wzxhzdk:31


You can even use the ``format()`` method:


wzxhzdk:32


In addition, file objects support a ``write()`` method that can be used to write raw data. For 
example, the ``print`` statement in the previous example could have been written this way:


wzxhzdk:33


Although these examples have worked with files, the same techniques apply to the standard output 
and input streams of the interpreter. For example, if you wanted to read user input interactively, 
you can read from the file ``sys.stdin``. If you want to write data to the screen, you can write 
to ``sys.stdout``, which is the same file used to output data produced by the ``print`` statement. 
For example:


wzxhzdk:34


This code can also be shortened to the following:


wzxhzdk:35


</div>

<h2 id="strings">Strings</h2>
<div class="p-content">

Create strings like this:


wzxhzdk:36


The use of triple-quoted strings allow us to capture all the text that appears prior to the 
terminating triple quote, as opposed to single -and double- quoted strings, which must be specified 
on one logical line. Triple-quoted strings are useful when the contents of a string literal span 
multiple lines of text such as the following:


wzxhzdk:37


Strings are stored as sequences of characters indexed by integers, starting at **zero (0)**. To 
extract a single character, use the indexing operator ``s[i]`` like this:


wzxhzdk:38


To extract a substring, use the slicing operator ``s[i:j]``. This extracts all characters from *s* 
whose index *k* is in the range *i <= k < j*. If either index is omitted, the beginning or end of 
the string is assumed, respectively:


wzxhzdk:39


If you want to concatenate strings, use the plus (+) operator:


wzxhzdk:40


Python never implicitly interprets the contents of a string as numerical data. For example, ``+`` 
always concatenates strings:


wzxhzdk:41


To perform mathematical calculations, strings first have to be converted into a numeric value using 
a function such as ``int()`` or ``float()``. For example:


wzxhzdk:42


Non-string values can be converted into a string representation by using the ``str()``, ``repr()``, 
or ``format()`` function. See how this works:


wzxhzdk:43


Although ``str()`` and ``repr()`` both create strings, their output is usually slightly 
different. ``str()`` produces the output that you get when you use the ``print`` statement, 
whereas ``repr()`` creates a string that you type into a program to exactly represent the
value of an object.

The ``format()`` function is used to convert a value to a string with a specific formatting applied. 
For example:


wzxhzdk:44

</div>

<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
<div class="p-content">

*Lists* are sequences of arbitrary objects. You create a list by enclosing values in square 
brackets:


wzxhzdk:45


Lists are indexed by integers, starting with **zero (0)**. Use the indexing operator to access and
modify individual items of the list:


wzxhzdk:46


To append new items to the end of a list, use the ``append()`` method:


wzxhzdk:47


To insert an item into a specific position of a list, use the ``insert()`` method:


wzxhzdk:48


You can extract or reassign a portion of a list by using the slicing operator:


wzxhzdk:49


To concatenate lists, use the plus (+) operator:


wzxhzdk:50


Create an empty list in these two ways:


wzxhzdk:51


Lists can contain any kind of Python object, including other lists:


wzxhzdk:52


Items contained in nested lists are accessed by applying more than one indexing operation:


wzxhzdk:53


Imagine that you have a data file like this one:


wzxhzdk:54


This script reads a list of numbers from a data file specified on the command line and shows the
minimum and maximum values:


wzxhzdk:55


Running the program with ``python3.6``, the output is:


wzxhzdk:56


The first line of this program uses the ``import`` statement to load the ``sys`` module from the 
Python library. This module is being loaded in order to obtain command-line arguments.

The ``open()`` function uses a filename that has been supplied as a command-line option and placed 
in the list ``sys.argv``. The ``readlines()`` method reads all the input lines into a list of 
strings.

The expression ``[float(line) for line in lines]`` constructs a new list by looping over all the 
strings in the list ``lines`` and applying the function ``float()`` to each element. This 
particularly powerful method of constructing a list is known as a *list comprehension*. Because the 
lines in a file can also be read using a ``for`` loop, the program can be shortened by converting 
values using as shown:


wzxhzdk:57


After the input lines have been converted into a list of floating-point numbers, the 
built-in ``min()`` and ``max()`` functions compute the minimum and maximum values.

</div>

<h2 id="tuples">Tuples</h2>
<div class="p-content">

To create simple data structures, you can pack a collection of values together into a single 
object using a *tuple*. You create a tuple by enclosing a group of values in parentheses:


wzxhzdk:58


Python often recognizes that a tuple is intended even if the parentheses are missing:


wzxhzdk:59


Tuples of 0 (empty) and 1-element have to be defined like this:


wzxhzdk:60


The values in a tuple can be extracted by numerical index just like a list. However, it is more 
common to unpack tuples into a set of variables:


wzxhzdk:61


Although tuples support most of the same operations as lists (such as indexing, slicing, and 
concatenation), the contents of a tuple cannot be modified after creation (that is, you cannot 
replace, delete, or append new elements to an existing tuple). This reflects the fact that a 
tuple is best viewed as a single object consisting of several parts, not as a collection of 
distinct objects to which you might insert or remove items.

Because there is so much overlap between tuples and lists, some programmers are inclined to ignore 
tuples altogether and simply use lists because they seem to be more flexible. Although this works, 
it wastes memory if your program is going to create a large number of small lists (that is, each 
containing fewer than a dozen items). This is because lists slightly overallocate memory to 
optimize the performance of operations that add new items. Because tuples are immutable, they use 
a more compact representation where there is no extra space.

Tuples and lists are often used together to represent data. For example, this program shows how you 
might read a file consisting of different columns of data separated by commas. The datafile has 
this structure:


wzxhzdk:62


The script is:


wzxhzdk:63


The ``split()`` method of strings splits a string into a list of fields separated by the given 
delimiter character. The resulting ``portfolio`` data structure created by this program looks like 
a two-dimension array of rows and columns. Each row is represented by a tuple and can be accessed 
as follows:


wzxhzdk:64


Individual items of data can be accessed like this:


wzxhzdk:65


Here's an easy way to loop over all of the records and expand fields into a set of variables:


wzxhzdk:66
